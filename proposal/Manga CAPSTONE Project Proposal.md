## Manga CAPSTONE Project Proposal

1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use
React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in
becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this
project.
	- I'll be using React for the front-end and either Flask/Node for the back-end.

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
	- It will be a full-stack application.

3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
	- Website.
	
4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
	- My goal is to build a website where fans of manga are able to interact in an online community about some of their favorite stories.
	
5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
	- Fans of Anime/Manga would be the primary demographic but also a great foundation for new fans of any age to indulge in.
6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.
	- The data I plan on using for my Manga CAPSTONE project would include information about manga titles, authors, publishers, genres, and potentially user-generated content such as reviews and discussion posts. I plan on collecting this data from external APIs.
	
7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project:

		a. What does your database schema look like?
			- It could potentially include tables for manga titles,
			authors, publishers, genres, and user accounts.
			
		b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? 
			- Issues with the API could include unreliable or incomplete
			data, inconsistent formatting, or limitations on the number
			of requests that can be made.
			
		c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
			- User data, such as passwords and email addresses, should
			be securely stored and encrypted to protect users' privacy
			and prevent unauthorized access.
			
		d. What functionality will your app include?
			- The app will include features such as a search function 
			for manga titles and authors, user registration and login,
			the ability to save favorite manga titles, a community forum
			for users to discuss and review manga titles.
			
		e. What will the user flow look like?
			- Users will be able to search for manga titles and authors,
			create an account or log in to their existing account, save
			their favorite manga titles, access the community forum to
			discuss and review manga titles.
			
		f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app?
			- The community forum and user-generated content features
			will make the site more than a simple CRUD app.
		
		h. What are your stretch goals?
			- Stretch goals could include implementing a recommendation
			system for manga titles based on user preferences or 
			integrating social media sharing functionality.
