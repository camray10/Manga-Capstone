I am creating an engaging manga app that not only introduces people to the world of manga but also helps them discover new titles and explore the amazing community. By leveraging the power of a Manga API, I can create an app that is both interesting and informative, allowing users to easily access and enjoy their favorite manga titles while also discovering new ones. My goal is to provide a unique and enjoyable experience for manga enthusiasts and newcomers alike, while also contributing to the growing popularity of this captivating medium.

*Plans for implementation:*

+ Manga search & discovery
+ Manga social sharing
+ Manga collections
+ Manga news
+ Manga community
+ Login/Authentication
